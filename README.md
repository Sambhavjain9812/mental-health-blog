The project titled “Working with the Mind” is a web development project made for the purpose of serving the students of Jaypee Institute of Information Technology. This project mainly consists of a Mental Health Improvement web site wherein it contains a section in which students can gain inspiration from renowned celebrities who have been open about their illnesses. Further, it has a web page where we have listed a few Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to help students gain knowledge about Mental Health, a web page consisting of a few remedies to improve certain mental health conditions and a form to help in assessment of Mental Health Condition. The main part of the project is the Blogging section in which students can share about their experiences or even just read about others’ experiences in order to gather motivation from fellow students and alumnus.
